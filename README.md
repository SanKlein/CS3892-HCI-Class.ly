PLEASE READ!!!

NOTE ON REQUIREMENT DOCUMENT: 
9/23 -- Formatting on the document is off by a line or so.This caused a few strange gaps in the document spacing. This happened during conversion from a Word document to .pdf format. Sorry for the inconvenience, but all of the actual content is there as it should be.

NOTE ON DATA ANALYSIS & PROTOTYPING DOCUMENT:
10/1 -- Formatting on the document is off by a line or so when you get to the low fidelity prototype wireframes. This happened during conversion from a Word document to PDF document. Sorry for the inconvensience, but all of the actual content is there as it should be.

Thanks,
Parker & Mitch
